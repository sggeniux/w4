## Theme Authors

You are a WordPress agency and would like to make your theme compliant with our plugin?

First of all, by default our plugin will work out of the box with any theme. [Read this](frequently-asked-questions.html#will-this-plugin-be-compatible-with-my-wordpress-theme-) for further explanation.
