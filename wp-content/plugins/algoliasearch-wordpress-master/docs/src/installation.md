## About pricing

This plugin relies on the [Algolia service](https://www.algolia.com/) which requires you to [create an account here](https://www.algolia.com/users/sign_up).
Algolia offers its Search as a Service provider on a incremental payment program, including a free Hacker Plan which includes 10,000 records & 100,000 operations per month. Beyond that, plans start at $49/month.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
Note that there isnâ€™t a direct correlation between the number of posts in WordPress and the number of records in Algolia.
Also note that we only offer support to paying plans.
On average, you can expect to have about 10 times more records than you have posts, though this is not a golden rule and you could end up with more records.
